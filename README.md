I have had troubles with uploading to github and commiting files. Please follow these steps to have the submission work. 

download file.

delete package-lock.json

From terminal run npm install

run npm i --save firebase@4.0.0 angularfire2@4.0.0-rc.1


then run ng serve --port 8080 --host 0.0.0.0 --disableHostCheck true

This should leave the project running on port 8080
